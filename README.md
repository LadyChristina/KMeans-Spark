# KMeans-Spark
Clustering two-dimensional data using k-means (from Mllib) in Spark. 

Determine optimal number of clusters for the dataset based on the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) metric. 
Compute the mean Silhouette score for every cluster, granted that the data points in every cluster are normally distributed.
Detect the outliers in every cluster, granted the normal distribution again.

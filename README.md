# KMeans-Spark
Clustering two-dimensional data using k-means (from Mllib) in Spark. Determining optimal number of clusters for the dataset based on the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) metric. Computing the mean Silhouette score for every cluster, granted that the data points in every cluster are normally distributed. Detecting the outliers in every cluster, granted the normal distribution again.
